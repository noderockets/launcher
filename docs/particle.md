# Particle Photon

[Particle](https://particle.io) is IoT platform that provides a complete solution for building IoT products.  They provide cloud based api's for communicating and controlling devices.  The [Photon](https://www.particle.io/products/hardware/photon-wifi) is a microcontroller that connects and talks to the Particle cloud via a built in WiFi chip.  We will use the photon to build an application that we can use to control the launcher.

#### Setting up a Photon

After creating a Particle account, you can claim and setup a Photon by using Particle's mobile app or browser-based tools.  You can also use their [CLI](https://docs.particle.io/guide/tools-and-features/cli/photon/) tools to setup and interact with your particle devices.

To get started with your Photon you can follow the [Getting Started](https://docs.particle.io/guide/getting-started/start/photon/) guide.
