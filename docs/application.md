# Building an Application

Particle provides a [Web IDE](https://docs.particle.io/guide/getting-started/build/photon/) that we can use to build applications for the Photon.  Applications are basically custom firmware that run whenever the device is powered up.  

When you are ready to run your code on your device you can use the the Web IDE to compile and flash the new code onto the photon.
