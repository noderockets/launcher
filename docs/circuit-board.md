The circuit board for the launcher is comprised of a [particle photon](particle.md) chip which is wireless capable and has a set of GPIO pins. 

Of those GPIO pins, 3 are used to control the launch by sending a signal to three electromagnetic valves. The three valves control air into the rocket and finally the launch itself is controlled wi
th a pneumatic cylinder which powers the release mechanism which sends the rocket into the air.
