The circuit board for the launcher is comprised of a [particle photon](particle.md) chip which is wireless capable and has a set of GPIO pins. Of those GPIO pins, 3 are used to control the launch by sending a signal to three electromagnetic valves. The three valves control air into the rocket and finally the launch itself is controlled with a pneumatic cylinder which powers the release mechanism which sends the rocket into the air.
devices.  The [Photon](https://www.particle.io/products/hardware/photon-wifi) is a microcontroller that connects and talks to the Particle cloud via a built in WiFi chip.  We will use the photon to build an application that we can use to control the launcher.
